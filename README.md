# VBA Challenge

##Project Overview
Steve's parents are interested in investing their money in green energy stocks.   He is concerned about diversifying their investment, so he created a list potential stocks to analyze.  This challenge will refactor VBA code to make it run faster in order to analyze a large dataset of stock information.



## Results
The stocks in our dataset performed significantly better in 2017 versus 2018 as a group.   This could be related to the political climate between those years, as well as the relative start up dates of the companies in this sector.   

The refactored code ran significantly faster since we were able to optimize the For Loop sequencing.   This code is better suited to handle larger datasets efficiently.

## Conclusion

 The advantages of refactoring code include the ability to handle larger amounts of data with faster computing speeds and using less computing power.   It allows a coder to utilize existing code that has been tested and make it more efficient.  The disadvantages include the limitations of the existing code that may have been created to solve specific, as opposed to general, solutions.


The advantages of the original VBA script is that it contained the specific stocks that were requested to be analyzed.  The disadvantages is that it is not scalable to handle multiple new stocks or larger datasets.
